<p>This past weekend I returned to my old stomping grounds (aka “science policy”) and had the opportunity through the AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Annual Meeting in Phoenix to present some of my ongoing research into extreme heat impacts on energy demand. It also marked the first time since starting my PhD that I traveled and attended a conference by myself. Somehow, the experience was so much better than I could have anticipated!</p>

<p>I do enjoy exploring hotels and on my first night rushed back into my room to change into a set of professional clothing upon stumbling into a large (and full of free dinner) AAAS mixer on the hotel second floor. Normally, large spaces with lots of people gives me pause … but by that point I was super hungry. Luckily, I happened upon a table of toxicology graduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and then we were later joined by two of the few Black women PhDs (both epidemiologists) I’d encountered since arriving. It was so interesting to leave my EPP bubble and encounter some of the serious lab-based research other students are doing. Otherwise, in discussing my research one of the women, who also happened to be a professor, gave me her business card to connect over extreme heat and connections to hospitalizations, a serious area I’ve underlooked in my work.</p>

<p>But the highlight by far was the final session I attended. I entered a packed “Science Policy Writing Workshop” and even reconnected with a former DC colleague sitting at my table. Towards the end of the session tables were meant to outline a potential policy memo and my table chose my research topic and outlined a memo to Public Utility Commissioners for the state of Arizona to better address disparities in energy affordability (considering extreme weather impacts or data centers) through improved housing and rate equalization. At one point in encouragement someone leaned over to me and said, “You’re the expert, what do you think?” Ha! When it came time to present there was only time for one group and almost immediately half the table pointed to me, so I went up to the microphone and gave all our points. [A severe heatwave and blackout in Phoenix could alone place half of residents at risk of hospitalization,](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/climate/blackout-heat-wave-danger.html) so addressing energy burdens felt incredibly relevant and impactful. Despite my nerves at the mic, I felt I did a pretty solid job.</p>

<p>This conference meant a lot to me. I’m excited to continue working on translating science for a policy audience and ideally add some of that work here. At times I find being a Black woman in STEM spaces to be invalidating, and having so many people throughout the conference express interest and curiosity around my research area was deeply validating. I connected to a few graduate students as part of the larger SNAP (Science Network for Advancing Policy) organization and can’t wait to keep diving and connecting across science policy.</p>
