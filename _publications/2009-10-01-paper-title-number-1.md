This paper develops a nanoscale method to "poke" at the surface of UV-weathered polyethylene to simulate nanoplastics generation under realistic mechanical and UV weathering conditions. This work highlights how UV exposure fundamentally changes the wear mechanism and increases nanoplastic release rates by an order of magnitude, enabling more physics-based predictions of environmental nanoplastic generation.
