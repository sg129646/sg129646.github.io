## Summary
This paper develops a nanoscale method to simulate nanoplastic generation from UV-weathered polyethylene under environmentally relevant mechanical conditions. We show that UV exposure fundamentally shifts the dominant wear mechanism and increases nanoplastic release rates by an order of magnitude, enabling more physics-based estimates of environmental nanoplastic production.
