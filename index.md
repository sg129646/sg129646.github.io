I’m a Ph.D. student in Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University.  
My research examines energy equity, extreme heat, and residential electricity consumption, 
with a focus on how climate stress disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.

I study how households adapt to extreme heat, how energy burden shapes cooling behavior, 
and how policy design can support equitable and resilient energy systems. My work integrates 
large-scale utility records, high-resolution weather data, and empirical modeling.
