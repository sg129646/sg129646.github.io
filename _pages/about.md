I’m a second year Ph.D. student in the joint Engineering & Public Policy and Civil & Environmental Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon University. My research examines energy equity, extreme heat, and residential electricity consumption, with a focus on how climate stress disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.

I study how households adapt to extreme heat, how energy burden shapes cooling behavior, and how policy design can support equitable and resilient energy systems. My work integrates large-scale utility records, high-resolution weather data, and empirical modeling. Feel free to connect with me!
