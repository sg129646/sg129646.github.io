I’m a second year Ph.D. student in the joint Engineering & Public Policy and Civil & Environmental Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon University. My research examines energy equity, extreme heat, and residential electricity consumption, with a focus on how climate stress disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.

Outside of research I enjoy taking boxing classes, playing with my cat ChiChi, reading Afro Lit, watching movies, and crocheting. I'm leaving some fun photos below!
