<p>
  I’m a second year Ph.D. student in the joint Engineering &amp; Public Policy and Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering program at Carnegie Mellon University.
  My research examines energy equity, extreme heat, and residential electricity consumption,
  with a focus on how climate stress disproportionately affects vulnerable communities.

<p>
  I study how households adapt to extreme heat, how energy burden shapes cooling behavior,
  and how policy design can support equitable and resilient energy systems. My work integrates
  large-scale utility records, high-resolution weather data, and empirical modeling. Feel free to connect with me!
