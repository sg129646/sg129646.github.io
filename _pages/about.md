Hi, I’m Stacy Godfreey-Igwe—a Ph.D. student in Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. My research explores the intersection of energy equity, extreme heat, and residential electricity consumption, with a particular focus on vulnerable communities disproportionately affected by climate change.

This website serves as a hub for my academic work and professional interests. Here you’ll find:

- My latest **publications** and **research projects**
- **Talks** I’ve given at conferences and seminars
- Teaching materials and course links
- A curated **portfolio** of data visualizations and policy analysis
- A dynamically generated **CV**
- Occasional blog posts about energy policy, data science, and life in academia

I'm passionate about bridging technical insight with policy relevance—especially in service of just and equitable energy systems. Feel free to browse the site or [get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to collaborate or learn more about my work.

Thanks for visiting!
